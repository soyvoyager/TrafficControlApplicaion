# TrafficControlApplicaion
Using Deep learning techniques for road detection and vehicle detection

In this project we are going to recognize roads and vehicles on the road for traffic management by using live images capturedd by satellite. So for doing that we are going to access the satellite data provided by Dutch Government for research use for Netherlands. At first we are going to extract image tiles by choosing the region for which we want to work. https://github.com/soyvoyager/TrafficControlApplicaion/blob/master/Code%20snipet%20for%20extracting%20tiles.ipynb This python code we are going to use for extraction of tiles. The Tile images are going to be stored in mentioned directory in code.
